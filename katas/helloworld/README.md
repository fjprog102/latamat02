# Hello World with C#!
The first kata is the simplest kata we can think of, just create a hello world project that prints "Hello, World!" message in the console. Goal of this kata is to verify that we have
correct tools installed and we can run C# code with a dotnet project

```
dotnet new console -o <your name>
```

Make sure project runs, commit code and push a new branch using the format `<your name>/helloworld`
